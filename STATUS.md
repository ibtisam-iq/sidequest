# STATUS — sidequest build log

Append-only running log of what has actually been built. Newest entries at the bottom.
Never overwrite a prior entry.

Read `CLAUDE.md` first for working context, then this file for current state.
`docs/PLAN.md` holds the approved build plan.

## 2026-08-22 — Phase 1/10 (~10%) — Repo scaffold

**Built**

- `.claude/settings.json` with `includeCoAuthoredBy: false` (pre-existing, confirmed correct)
  so no commit or PR body carries a `Co-Authored-By` / "Generated with Claude Code" trailer.
- `CLAUDE.md` — full working context: what the project is, repo structure, both entity schemas,
  the open taxonomy system, conventions, how to run everything, what each script does, the
  Actions overview, and the issue-form security rules.
- `STATUS.md` — this file.
- `docs/PLAN.md` — the approved build plan, committed so it survives the session.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant 2.1.
- Root `package.json` and `.gitignore`.

**Verified against the live registry / Astro tarball rather than assumed**

- Astro **7.2.4** is current, requires Node ≥22.12.0 (local v25.6.0 ✓). CI will pin Node 22.
- Astro 7 still ships `astro/loaders` (`glob`, `file`) and `astro/zod`; `glob({ base })` accepts an
  absolute file URL **outside** the site root — this is what lets Astro read repo-root `data/`
  with no copying or symlinking.
- `.yaml`/`.yml` is a registered data entry type in Astro core, so the glob loader parses YAML
  natively — no custom parser needed.
- js-yaml **5.3.0** is current (4.x is now `v4-legacy`), ESM-native, still exports `load`/`dump`.
  Its YAML-1.2 CORE default schema does **not** coerce timestamps → dates are stored as quoted
  ISO strings.
- `@astrojs/sitemap` 3.7.3 declares no peer range, so it installs against Astro 7; to be confirmed
  at build time, with a hand-rolled prerendered `sitemap.xml.ts` as the fallback.

**Decided**

- Entry counts are **computed, never stored** in the taxonomy registry (avoids every single-entry
  PR conflicting on one shared line).
- Homepage is a **curated landing page**; exhaustive browsing lives on `/links` and `/companies`.
- Slug uniqueness is **per collection**, not global across links and companies.
- JSON Schema is the single source of truth; Astro zod schemas are generated from it.
- Engagement features (upvotes, bookmarks, verified badges, accounts) are **rejected by decision**
  as incompatible with the static no-database design.

**Next:** Phase 2 — `schema/link.schema.json`, `schema/company.schema.json`,
`taxonomy/categories.yaml` seeded with 10 real link categories + `pakistan`, and 8–10 real seed
entries including a mutually-linked `alternatives` pair to prove the schemas out.
